## Description
A JavaScript quiz to test your knowledge. 

After clicking start, the user has 60 seconds to answer a series of JavaScript related questions. When a question is answered correctly, 10 seconds is added to the timer. When answered incorrectly, 10 seconds is subtracted.

If the user finishes the quiz before time runs out, their score is recorded and added to the highscore database. (Only the top 5 scores make the list)
